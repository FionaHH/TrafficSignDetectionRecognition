TrafficSignDetectionRecgnition
==============================
Features of this topic:

  1) In Detection phase, a very high speed RGB to HSV convertion algorithm is implement based on looking-up table.\n
  2) In Recognition phase, in our opinion, a linear svm classifier, is suffice for classification.\n

Software requirement:

  1) Libsvm for c++\n
  2) OpenCV
